        <h2>Woodwork</h2>
        <p class="description">
          These panels are carved in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, using rosewood
          and sheesham. Tools include chisels, mallets, and hand planes made by
          local toolmakers. Each design is sketched by hand and carved with
          precision over several days. The wood is sourced from sustainably
          managed forests near the foothills of the Himalayas. Artisans often
          work in family-run workshops, where skills are passed down through
          generations. Before carving begins, the wood is seasoned for weeks to
          prevent warping. Each panel reflects not just craftsmanship, but the
          cultural motifs of Mughal and Rajasthani architecture.

        <h2>Pottery Making</h2>
        <p class="description">
          These clay pots are crafted in Khurja, Uttar Pradesh. Clay is sourced
          from riverbeds and refined manually. Pottery wheels are built from
          wood and iron, and pigments are made from minerals and ash. Each pot
          is sun-dried and kiln-fired.The process begins with artisans kneading
          the clay by foot to achieve the perfect consistency. Each pot is
          shaped with care, often guided by muscle memory and years of
          experience. Once formed, the pots are painted with natural colors
          inspired by local festivals, flora, and folklore. Firing takes place
          in traditional brick kilns fueled by dried leaves and twigs, giving
          the pottery its signature earthy finish. These handcrafted pieces are
          sold in village haats and urban craft fairs, connecting rural
          tradition with modern appreciation.
